        <p>This workbook is due on Thursday, May 5, 2022.</p><p>This workbook is a chance to put everything from class together!</p>
<p>There is one big box: Graphics Town. It is a separate page <a href="./for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students">final-grtown.html</a>. There are a bunch of text boxes on <a href="./docs/2/">Page &nbsp;2&nbsp; (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a></p>
<p>Rather than having a lot of small boxes, there is a single big window. And in it, you get to make a world. It&rsquo;s a chance for you to be creative and make something cool.</p>
<p>We realize that you have limited time to do this, so our expectations are reasonable.</p>
<p>Unlike other workbooks, the detailed instructions and rubric for graphics town are not in the workbook. The workbook has links to the web.  This allows us to make clarifications if necessary. If a change is made after the assignment is released, it will be noted at the top of the page. We will make announcements of important changes on Canvas.</p>
<p>Start with <a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/grtown" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Also: note that on <a href="./docs/2/">Page  2  (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a> there are text boxes for you to fill in. A key rule of graphics town: you only get points for what you document in the text boxes! If you do it, but don&rsquo;t describe it (as the instructions tell you), you didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To gain experience applying the concepts from class in order to create something more interesting</li>
    <li>To apply texturing techniques to create appearances</li>
    <li>To practice fitting different types of models together to make a scene</li>
    <li>To experiment with methods for creating objects and behaviors</li>
    <li>To experiment with advanced interactive graphics techniques</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="due-date-and-grading">Due Date and Grading</h2>
<p>Note: this &ldquo;final project&rdquo; is not graded as a workbook and has different rules. It is a separate thing in grading (it counts for 10% of your grade). It will be graded on an A-F scale, which we will then translate to the 0-100 scale to put into Canvas. Unlike the University, we do give A+. We don&rsquo;t often given A++ (An A+ translates to 95 when we convert to Canvas numbers).</p>
<p>The assignment is due the last day of classes, May 5, 2022. Late assignments will be penalized. We cannot accept late assignments after 8am, Monday, May 9 unless there are extreme circumstances (e.g., a medical emergency). See (<a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/grtown" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Instructions</a>) for more details.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;rubric&rdquo; is given at <a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/rubric" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Rubric</a>, but be warned: it is not the specific &ldquo;point counting&rdquo; rubrics we have had for prior assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> as with Workbooks, you must both commit and push your work to GitHub as well as complete the handin survey.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-collaboration">A Note on Collaboration</h2>
<p>Every student must turn in an assignment: you are not allowed to work in groups. You may use some objects from others, but read the instructions.</p>
<p>Please be sure to read <a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/grtown/#collaboration-use-re-use-and-attribution" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Attribution Instructions</a>.</p>
