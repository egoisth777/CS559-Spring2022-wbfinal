<h3 id="general-instructions">General Instructions</h3>
<p>When referring to objects in the text boxes below, put the name of an instance of the object as it appears in the &ldquo;lookat selector&rdquo;, put a &ldquo;*&rdquo; after the name of the object if it is highlighted. So, in the example I might put <code>SimpleHouse-5*</code></p>
<p>Replace the ??? with your response. When you are done, there should be no ??? in any text box. Please leave the file as intact as possible (any text other than the ??? please leave)</p>
<h3 id="theme">Theme</h3>
<p>Describe the theme or idea behind your town - what were you trying to create? <a href="../../for_students/final-02-theme.txt" class="for_students">final-02-theme.txt</a>.</p>

<h3 id="object-list">Object List</h3>
<p>This textbox asks for a list of the objects you use for the &ldquo;Object Quantity and Diversity&rdquo; Requirements. Please keep the &ldquo;list forms&rdquo; (e.g., the numbering given) - and you don&rsquo;t need to list more things here than there are lines in the file. For each object, give the name of <em>one</em> instance of it that can be found in the highlight list, and a short description. Mention if you give attribution in the box below.</p>
<p>Note: by &ldquo;kind&rdquo; of object we mean a distinct type of object. For example, you might have a car that you make 10 versions of.</p>
<p>For example, here are example lines for things in the example:</p>
<pre><code>1. SimpleHouse-5* - a textured house made of basic geometry from WB9
Building: SimpleHouse-5* (described above)
Model: &quot;Track Car&quot; - loaded from an FBX file from the web, attribution below
</code></pre>

<h3 id="behavior-list">Behavior List</h3>
<p>This textbox asks how you fill the Behavior requirements. For each, give an example object (that should be highlighted), and a description.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-things">Advanced Things</h3>
<p>Describe each of the &ldquo;Advanced Things&rdquo; that you attempted and think you should get points for. For each one that your did, be sure to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give the name and number of the type of advanced thing (see the numbers on <a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/advaced" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Advanced Things</a>)</li>
<li>Give an example object (in the highlight list) that we can look at to see it</li>
<li>Give a brief description of what you did (a sentence or two is usually fine, it should be obvious if it works).</li>
</ol>
<p>For each one start it with <code>AdvancedThing:</code> - and put a blank line between them. You should list all the things that you think qualify.</p>


<details class="myexpand" >
    <summary class="myexpand-head">Example description</summary>
    <div class="markdown-inner myexpand-content">
      <p>Here is an example of what it might look like (for some of the things in the example objects).</p>
<pre><code>AdvancedThing: Morphing (#6)
Example: LookAt: MorphTest 
The MorphTest object uses shape interpolation between a sphere
and a flat shape using THREE's morphing implementation.

AdvancedThing: Complex Behavior (#2)
Example: Drive/Follow Helicopter-0
The Helicopter-0 has a behavior with a state machine. The
helicopter takes off, chooses one of the helipads at random,
turns to go in that direction, flies there, and lands.

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;text box&rdquo; - but is an &ldquo;image box&rdquo;. Take a screenshot of your program. Replace the image &ldquo;screenshot.png&rdquo; in the <code>for_students</code> directory with your image. It should show up here (replacing one from the example):</p>
<p><img src="../../for_students/screenshot.png" width="300px" /></p>
