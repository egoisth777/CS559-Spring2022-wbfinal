		<div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>For this assignment, (most of) the instructions and rubric are on the course web, not inside the workbook.</p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> Make a &ldquo;town&rdquo; in the world on the <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students">final-grtown.html</a> page in the workbook. Get points for making things. Document what you do on <a href="../../docs/2/">Page  2  (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a>. If it&rsquo;s cool, you&rsquo;ll get a good grade.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there a long version?</strong> Students often want to know &ldquo;how much do I need to make?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;how cool does it have to be?&rdquo; But, we want to make things be flexible because students can be <strong>very</strong> creative, and we want to encourage that.</p>
<p>The hard part is quantifying “enough” and “cool”. We might say “you’ll know it when you see it.” But instead, we have to try to write something…</p>
<p>Note: the graphics town &ldquo;box&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t shown on this page - it is a separate html file: <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students">final-grtown.html</a>.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of pages explaining what you should do. There is <a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Index</a> which links to:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/grtown" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Instructions</a></li>
<li><a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/rubric" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Rubric</a> - This is useful because it implies the things you should do.</li>
<li><a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/hints" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Hints</a> - This includes an explanation of some aspects of the framework, as well as some hints of students have asked about in the past.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must document (in the textboxes on <a href="../../docs/2/">Page  2  (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a>) what you do in order to get credit.</li>
<li>Add any files that you create to the repository.</li>
<li>Push early and often - it provides a backup in case something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Be aware of the collaboration policy (on <a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/grtown" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Instructions</a>)</li>
<li>Keep the user interface on <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students">final-grtown.html</a> - you can add things to it, but we need the functions (like the &ldquo;grader&rdquo; button)</li>
<li>Be careful to keep performance reasonable, and not to make your repository be too huge. See <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/posts/graphics-performance/">Some Notes on Graphics Performance for 559 Assignments</a> for advice.</li>
<li>Complete the handin survey when you are done (and have committed and pushed)</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the workbook, there is <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students">final-grtown.html</a> page and its associated <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.js" class="for_students">final-grtown.js</a>. This is where your town goes. There is also an <code>examples</code> directory, which gives you some sample stuff to get started.</p>
<p>We have given you a basic &ldquo;world&rdquo; to start. It is really more of a collection of random objects than a &ldquo;town.&rdquo; You may use these objects in your town, but you should arrange things in a more meaningful manner. In fact, you should not use the <code>main</code> function that we provide as an example. Note that one of the &ldquo;basic requirements&rdquo; is that your assignment &ldquo;is visually distinct from the example provided.&rdquo; (see <a href="https:/pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/grtown/rubric" target="_blank">2022 Graphics Town Rubric</a>)</p>
<p>You need to highlight some of <strong>your</strong> objects. As an example, we have highlighted some of our objects - but you can only highlight objects that you created. Be sure to remove the highlighting of our objects.</p>
<p>The next page <a href="../../docs/2/">Page  2  (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a> has a number of text boxes for you to fill to document what you have done. Remember the rule of graphics town: you only get credit for what you document!</p>
